# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Arduino Lint

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # workflow_dispatch event allows the workflow to be triggered manually
  # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch
  workflow_dispatch:
  # repository_dispatch event allows the workflow to be triggered via the GitHub API
  # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch
  repository_dispatch:
  
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  arduino-lint:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs the arduino lint to check library compliance
      - uses: arduino/arduino-lint-action@main
#        with:
#          library-manager: update
